An ai chatbot to serve as a "rubber duck" for when you're stuck on a project.

## Summary

Desk Duck aims to be a an AI Assistant to help with programming. You can ask it about various programming questions. It is designed to help get over coding hurdles by helping you think through problems and get over errors faster.  Desk Duck uses webcam capabilities to track user's eye contact and begins listening upon contact. It is voice operated and outputs audio and to command line. It uses stt (speech to text) to accept user input and tts (text to speech) to output an answer. In it's current iteration it does not yet interact with the code directly. We are aiming to add that in the future.
